# SemaphoreAssignment5
Explanation:
Very simple project that demonstrates how the use of semaphores can help avoid the critical section problem, since both threads share the variable counter.

How to run:
May need to download developer tools in order to compile and run the c program.
Once the developer tools are downloaded simply type the following:
  //cd to the location of the .c file
  gcc -o Assign5 Assign5.c
  ./Assign5
